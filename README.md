## How it Works

World Wide Check leverages a vast network of internet users and the collective wisdom of the online community to identify and report misleading information. By utilizing a subreddit dedicated to World Wide Check ([r/worldwidecheck](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwidecheck/)), all reported content is carefully examined and verified by a community of vigilant users.

## Reporting Potentially False or Misleading Information

Follow these steps to report potentially false or misleading information using World Wide Check:

### Step 1: Check Existing Reports

First, check if any information has already been reported for the current web page in the World Wide Check plugin.

### Step 2: Create a New Post

If no data is fetched, you're good to report. Go to [r/worldwidecheck](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwidecheck/) to create a new post.

Copy the paragraph from the web page and paste it as the post title. Make sure the text remains the same.

In the body of the post, it's crucial to add the fURL link as the last element. This provides the URL of the web page being reported.
